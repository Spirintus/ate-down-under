southcrosser_DESC;,,,,,,
The Church of the Southern Cross emerged after a prophet somewhere in the australian interior was given a new bible by Our Saviour, the Gospel. After that the church grew in numbers and spread like wildfire, both through missionary work and war. \n The head of the church is the archbishop, who lives and rules Brisbane. However he is elected by a council of bishops. \n Though some claim the church is not christian due to their refusal of the trinity (instead choosing to replace it with a system of four different forms of God), the majority still says they are christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

gnostic_full;The Church of Marcion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
gnostic_DESC;The ideas proposed by Marcion of Sinope are almost as old as Christianity itself, but the Church in its modern form was founded rather recently. It traces its origin to a dispute between the Elizabethan clergy and the mainstream Southcrosser opinion on the validity of the historical New Testament, eventually culminating in a schism between the Principality of Elizabeth and the rest of the Southcrosser church and the total rejection of the Southcrosser Gospel. It rejects the god of the Old Testament, claiming that the teachings of Jesus are incompatible with the genocidal maniac featured in the Old Testament. In game, they are unable to declare Holy Wars and have decreased martial stats to represent their pacifism and loving nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

true_church_DESC;True Church - After the event and the rise of the Church of the Southern Cross, the few australian christians who refused to switch their allegiance to the new church banded together and reorganized in the west, where the new faith was the weakest, forming the 'True and Christian Church of God and Jesus Christ', commonly known as the True Church. The religion blends aspects of several pre-existing denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

eruist_DESC;,,,,,,
Though the origins of Eruism are shrouded in mystery and legend, with some claiming it was founded by a prophet known only as ‘Tolkien’, it is known that this monotheistic religion only became widespread after the XXII century. Followers believe in Eru Ilúvatar, the only god and the creator of all life, though they also believe in countless other beings, like the Ainur, and in the prophecy of the Chosen One.
