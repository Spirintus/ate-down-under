southcrosser_DESC;
The Church of the Southern Cross emerged after a prophet somewhere in the australian interior was given a new bible by Our Saviour, the Gospel. After that the church grew in numbers and spread like wildfire, both through missionary work and war. \nThe head of the church is the archbishop, who lives and rules Brisbane. However he is elected by a council of bishops. \nThough some claim the church is not christian due to their refusal of the trinity (instead choosing to replace it with a system of four different forms of God), the majority still says they are christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gnostic_DESC;The early days of the life of Prophet Markos were rather adventurous. He was the son of a significant Westralian merchant, but in his twenties he traveled east, becoming a member of the Church of Southern Cross. He participated in the Third Crusade and fought on the front lines. After suffering a severe injury, he settled down in newly founded Kingdom of Elizabeth. There he wrote his Gospel of The Saviour, based on the Southcrosser version of Jesus' life, with the teaching of True Church and his newly acquired pacifistic and gnostic ideals influencing it significantly. /nMarkonites reject the Creator featured in Southcrosser Book of Journey and Book of Drought as a genocidal maniac and the doctrine of four distinct forms of God. Rather, Markonites direct their worship towards Jesus, who is seen as an aspect of a Saviour god sent to rescue humanity from earthly suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The religion blends aspects of several pre-existing denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

eruist_DESC;Though the origins of Eruism are shrouded in mystery and legend, with some claiming it was founded by a prophet known only as ‘Tolkien’, it is known that this monotheistic religion only became widespread after the XXII century. Followers believe in Eru Ilúvatar, the only god and the creator of all life, though they also believe in countless other beings, like the Ainur, and in the prophecy of the Chosen One.
